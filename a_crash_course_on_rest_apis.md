# A Crash Course on REST APIs

APIs are the backbone of software communication.

In the acronym API, the word "Application" refers to software that performs a
distinct function. An "Interface" is a contract between two applications that
defines a set of rules, protocols, and methods for communication. "Programming"
makes all of this possible.

APIs have been around for a long time in one form or the other:

* In the 60s and 70s, we had subroutines and libraries to share code and
  functionality between programs.
* In the 1980s, Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) emerged, allowing programs running
  on different computers to execute procedures on each other.
* With the widespread adoption of the Internet in the 2000s, web services such
  as SOAP became widely adopted.
* The late 2000s and early 2010s marked the rise of RESTful APIs, which have
  since become the dominant approach due to their simplicity and scalability.

In recent years, the API-first approach to software development has gained
significant traction, driven by the emphasis on building loosely coupled
services. REST APIs, in particular, have emerged as the go-to choice for
developers worldwide.

## REST API Cheatsheet

1. Client-Server: Emphasizes the separation of user interface concerns (Client)
  from data storage and processing concerns (Server) to enhance portability and
  scalability.
2. Stateless: Dictates that each request from a client to a server must contain
  all the necessary information for processing, ensuring no session state is
  stored on the server between requests. (???)
3. Cacheable: Ensures that responses can be explicitly marked as cacheable or
  non-cacheable, allowing clients to reuse previously fetched responses to
  enhance efficiency and reduce load.
4. Layered System: Architecture may have multiple layers, and a client interacts
  without knowing if it communicates with the end server or an intermediary
  layer, promoting scalability and security.
5. Code-on-Demand: Servers can temporarily extend or customize a client's
  functionality by transferring executable code, enhancing flexibility and
  adaptability.
6. Uniform Interface: A consistent and standardized interface simplifies and
  decouples interactions, making systems independent and easier to evolve.
